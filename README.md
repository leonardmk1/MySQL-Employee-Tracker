# MySQL-Employee-Tracker

 In this homework assignment, the challenge was to architect and build a solution for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL.  This application can do add departments, roles, employees
 view departments, roles, employees, update employee roles, update employee managers, and view employees by manager.

 ### User Story

 As a business owner
 I want to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company
 So that I can organize and plan my business.

### Acceptable Criteria

Use the MySQL NPM package to connect to your MySQL database and perform queries.

Use InquirerJs NPM package to interact with the user via the command-line.

Use console.table to print MySQL rows to the console. There is a built-in version of console.table, but the NPM package formats the data a little better for our purposes.

You may wish to have a separate file containing functions for performing specific SQL queries you'll need to use. Could a constructor function or a class be helpful for organizing these?

You will need to perform a variety of SQL JOINS to complete this assignment, and it's recommended you review the week's activities if you need a refresher on this.
